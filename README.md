# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This work builds on the existing Titanic survival prediction repository.
My contribution focuses on improving the modeling and evaluation by
experimenting with tree-based models and better evaluation strategies.

## Approach
- Studied the existing data preprocessing and baseline setup
- Implemented Random Forest models to capture non-linear patterns
- Performed feature engineering (e.g., `family_size`)
- Experimented with Gradient Boosting for improved performance
- Tuned decision thresholds to better balance precision and recall

## Results
- Accuracy improved to ~81%
- Best F1 score achieved: ~75
- Better recall–precision trade-off through threshold tuning

## Notes
Detailed experiments, metrics, and analysis are documented in the notebook
and accompanying documentation.
