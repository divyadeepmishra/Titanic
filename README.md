# Project: SinkOrSync Survival Prediction
*Started on: February 11, 2026*

## Project Overview
I am starting this Machine Learning project today on 11 feb 2026 to explore the Titanic dataset and my goal is to understand how data can predict survival outcomes using ML algorithms.

### My Plans Are:
To ensure I make steady progress, I am planning the following:
* **Daily Goal:** At least 30 minutes of focused work.
* **Focus Areas:** Data cleaning, visualization, and model tuning via learniing (by books and web) and AI.
* **Community:** Sharing my findings and errors within the gits.

## Daily Progress Log:

### Week 1: Exploring and Documenting code
#### Day 1: February 11, 2026
- **Tasks Completed:** - Forked the repository.
    - Analyzed the existing notebook.
    - Set up this progress tracking file.
- **Notes:** I observed that the current model is a **Logistic Regression** model and it has a good accuracy and scope of improvement.
